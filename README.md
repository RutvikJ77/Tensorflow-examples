# Tensorflow-examples
From the popular specializations provided by Deeplearning.ai - Practice notebooks of tensorflow.

### ----[Tensorflow in Practice](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice)----

This specialization focuses on the basics of the Tensorflow and deep learning model creation from developing Computer Vision techniques to solving Text based sequences using the Tokenizer and predicting the Time Series Forecast.

### ----[Tensorflow Data and deployment](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-data-and-deployment)----
Having learnt the basics of Tensorflow and its application, this specialization further moves on deploying tensorflow models on various platforms from the Web browser to the Mobile OS, even the basic TPU and Microprocessors like RaspberryPi were included. Furthermore after developing your model it is essential to know whether it is scalable and can be deployed to the real world or not? Go through the [Exercises](./Exercises) to find out more.
